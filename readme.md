# Cartoon CharacterList
### A Cartoon Network base character list written in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS! This was designed to demonstrate a passing project in Code Louisville Web Dev 1 Program.

#### Code Louisville Project Requirements
- A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon
- Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on a desktop.
- Use “:nth-child” or “nth-of-type” to style a series of elements on your page - for example, change the background color for every other row in a table 
- Create your own original CSS animation. For example, create a loading spinner or menu animation. Note: CSS Animations are not included in the assigned Pluralsight track, you will have to research this on your own
- Create at least 3 variables (var, const, or let), set their values in JavaScript, and display the values somewhere on your page
- Create one or more JavaScript objects (such as with multiple values contained in { }’s), modify at least one value of that object, and display it on your site
- Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code.

#### Side notes
- Many of the characters shown are not original and have been distributed by Cartoon Network.

#### Known Issues
- Sizing window from desktop to mobile, opening and closing the menu, and then resizing to desktop causes nav animation issues.
